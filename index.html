            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>The Yakama Empowerment Project was a student-led initiative created to support educational opportunities for students of the Yakama Nation, a federally recognized tribe in Washington State. Many schools in the community have historically been under-resourced. The project began after a mission trip and conversations with community members at Sacred Road Ministries, which revealed a significant need for books for a mobile library serving Indigenous children.</p>
            <p>In response, a small group of high school students organized book drives across local schools, collecting over one thousand books for K-12 readers. The books were delivered in person, and the student volunteers participated in a cultural workshop and dialogue with church elders, many of whom are Yakama community members. The project was not just about donating resources, but about building a respectful, long-term relationship based on listening and collaboration.</p>

            <h2>A Framework for Allyship</h2>
            <p>The project was guided by a framework for ethical engagement adapted from Bennett et al. (2024), centered on six key components of Indigenous allyship. This model helps ensure that projects are respectful, collaborative, and genuinely beneficial rather than paternalistic.</p>

                    <h3>1. Exposure</h3>
                    <p><strong>Learning and Revealing with Care.</strong> This involves educating oneself about the Indigenous community's history and current realities while being careful not to publicly share sensitive information without consent.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>2. Engagement</h3>
                    <p><strong>Building Genuine Partnerships.</strong> True allyship requires collaborating with the community from the very beginning, listening to their needs, and building real relationships.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>3. Empowerment</h3>
                    <p><strong>Enhancing Community Capacity.</strong> The goal is to strengthen the community's own resources and skills, leaving them more capable and independent, not creating dependency.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>4. Teaching</h3>
                    <p><strong>Two-Way Learning.</strong> Allies must be open to learning from Indigenous partners just as much as they may share their own knowledge. It is a process of reciprocal education.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>5. Accessibility</h3>
                    <p><strong>Removing Barriers.</strong> Projects and their benefits must be genuinely usable and reachable for the community, considering factors like internet access, language, and cost.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>6. Acknowledgement</h3>
                    <p><strong>Honoring Contributions and Sovereignty.</strong> This means publicly crediting the community's knowledge and leadership, respecting their authority, and being transparent about one's role as a learner.</p>
